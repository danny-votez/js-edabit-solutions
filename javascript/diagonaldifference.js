/*
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals. 
For example, the square matrix art is shown below: 123 456 989 The left-to-right diagonal 1+5+9=15. 
The right to left diagonal 3+5+9=17. Their absolute difference is 15-17 = 2. 
Function description Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below. diagonalDifference takes the following parameter: 
int arr[n][m]: an array of integers Return int: the absolute diagonal difference Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, 1, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr.
Each of the next 2 lines describes a row. arr[i], and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j]
